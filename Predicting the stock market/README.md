Linear Regression Project.


In this project, I'll be working with data from the S&P500 Index. 
The S&P500 is a stock market index. 

Some companies are publicly traded, which means that anyone can buy and sell their shares on the open market. 
A share entitles the owner to some control over the direction of the company, and to some percentage (or share) of the earnings of the company. 
When you buy or sell shares, it's common to say that you're trading a stock.

Indexes aggregate the prices of multiple stocks together, and allowing to see how the market as a whole is performing.

I'll be using historical data on the price of the S&P500 Index to make predictions about future prices.
