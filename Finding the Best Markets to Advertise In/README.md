Project on Statistics.
I pretended I'm working for an an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of our courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc.
We want to promote our product and we'd like to invest some money in advertisement. My goal in this project is to find out the two best markets to advertise our product in.
