Dataset Cleaning, Analysis and Speed of Algorithms Project

Accidents are an unfortunate fact of air travel. 
Although flying is statistically safer than driving, minor and major flying accidents occur daily.
In this project, I've worked with a data set of airplane accident statistics to analyze patterns and look for any common threads.
The data set contains 77,282 aviation accidents that occurred in the U.S. and the metadata associated with them. 
The data in AviationData.txt file comes from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).
