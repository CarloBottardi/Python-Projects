Neural Networks Project

In the neural networks framework, adding hidden layers of neurons to a neural network can improve its ability to capture nonlinearity in the data.

In this Project, I'll:

- explore why image classification is a hard task;
- observe the limitations of traditional machine learning models for image classification;
- train, test, and improve a few different deep neural networks for image classification.
