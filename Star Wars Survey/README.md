Definitive Project on data cleaning.
In this project I cleaned and analyzed a dataset of the team at FiveThirtyEight, created in order to answer urgent ontological question: 
- Does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best movie of Star Wars franchise?
To give an answer, they surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. They received 835 total responses, which you download from their GitHub repository.
