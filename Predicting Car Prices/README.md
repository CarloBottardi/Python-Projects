My first Machine Learning Project.
I explored the fundamentals of machine learning using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. 
In this project, I'll practice the machine learning workflow I've learned so far to predict a car's market price using its attributes. 
The data set I'll be working with contains information on various cars. 
For each car I have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more.
